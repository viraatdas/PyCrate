## Installation
```
pip install sullivan
```

## Usage

### Initialize a project
```
sullivan init <project_name>
```

Ex.
```
sullivan init my_project
```

This will produce:
```
my_project/
├── sullivan.toml
├── setup.py
├── src/
│   └── main.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py
├── target/
│   └── dependencies/
```

### Install a package
```
sullivan install <package_name>
```

### Configure repository 
```
sullivan configure <repository_url>
``` 

This can also be modified from the `sullivan.toml` file

### Run the project
```
sullivan run
```

### Run tests
```
sullivan test
```


### Generate documentation
```
sullivan doc
```


## Local dependency management
To mimic Cargo’s local installation approach:

- Dependencies will be installed in a target/dependencies directory within the project.
- Each project's environment will be isolated to ensure no conflicts with global Python packages.


## Notes 
- Ensure compatibility with existing tools and libraries within the Python ecosystem.
- Provide a clear and simple way to manage Python versions.
- Optimize performance for dependency resolution and installation.
